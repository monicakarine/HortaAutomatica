### Automated Garden Project with Arduino for the Project Laboratory II at UFMG. The project consists of a system that automatically waters the plants based on the reading of a humidity sensor. The system also includes an NTC thermistor sensor to measure temperature, an LDR photoresistor light intensity sensor, a button for system configuration, 3 indicator LEDs, and an LCD display.
